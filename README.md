# Acme-SpamHelper
The system must prevent the principals from storing any data that can be considered spam. A piece of text is considered spam if the number of spam terms exceeds a predefined spam threshold. The default list of spam terms includes the following ones: “sex”, “viagra”, “cialis”, “one million”, “you’ve won”, “nigeria”, and their corresponding translations into the languages considered for internationalisation; the default spam threshold is 10%. Note that the previous default values can be changed at will by the administrators. Realise that a term must be considered spam irrespective of its case and the blanks in between its words; for instance, “one␣million” is a spam term that matches “one␣million”, “ONE␣MILLION”, “OnE␣␣␣MiLLiOn”, or “One␣⏎␣Million”; it doesn’t match “One␣Millionaire”, “One␣or␣two␣millions”, or “One␣sexy␣million”, though. 

The spam detector must be reusable across different projects; that is: it must be implemented as an independent project that must be packaged into a reusable dependency.
